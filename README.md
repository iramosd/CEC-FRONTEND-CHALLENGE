## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ components/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ layout/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ composables/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â”‚
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ product/
â”‚       â”‚
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ products/
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Here's a brief description you can use for your README file to describe the structure of the folders:

---

### Project Structure

- **`/public/`**: Contains static assets like images, fonts, and other files that are served directly by the server. This folder is accessible publicly.

- **`/src/`**: The main source directory where all the application code resides.
    - **`/src/components/`**: Contains reusable Vue components that can be used throughout the application.
        - **`/src/components/layout/`**: Components specifically related to layout structure, such as headers, footers, and navigation bars.

    - **`/src/composables/`**: Contains reusable logic or composition functions (e.g., custom hooks) that can be shared across multiple components.

    - **`/src/layouts/`**: Layout components that define the general structure of different pages, often used to wrap the content of pages.

    - **`/src/pages/`**: Contains pages of the application.
        - **`/src/pages/product/`**: Specific to individual product related page.
        - **`/src/pages/products/`**: Contains components for pages displaying lists or collections of products.

- **`package.json`**: Defines project metadata, dependencies, scripts, and other configurations needed for building and running the project.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
